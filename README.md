# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems  
it helps in the creation of software applications 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Rise of agile methodologies 
Development of programming language
Establishment of software engineering 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement involves gathering and documentation of user needs
Design involves creating a high level and detailed design of user interface 
Implementation involves writing code and building software according to design specifications 
Testing involves conducting tests to ensure it meets standards 
Deployment involves releasing software to customers 
Maintenance provides ongoing updates on softwares

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential approach with distinct phases while agile involves an iterative approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and response to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer writes code
Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality 
project manager oversees planning,execution of software projects 
software engineering team design overall structure of systems 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing I.e visual studio
VCS tracks changes to source code I.e Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges 
tight deadlines,technical debt,changing requirements 
strategy to overcome challenges 
effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritising tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
testing unit tests individual components 
integration unit tests interaction in subsystems
acceptance tests software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
importance is it helps to identify and fix defects early in development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it is crafting questions or statements in order to get best response from AI
it gives AI direction for correct responses

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Translate this for me
Translate this Spanish sentence to English 
it is effective as it is able to give accurate response
